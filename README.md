# Kajculator
this is my first pure javascript application from the scratch!
# Ameliorations
I intend to extend it to a scientific version ... but only when i will find time for!
# use
This calculator can be served from any source to any web site just by calling th core script!
# how to call the Kajculator to my web site?
first save the full content in your web site directory i.e in a folder called calco
from any page of your site just add the script:
# <script type="text/javascrript" src="../calco/Kajculatrice.js" ></script>
# Enjoy :).
